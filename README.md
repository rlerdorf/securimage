## Description:

What is **Securimage**?

Securimage is a PHP class that is used to generate and validate CAPTCHA images.
    
The classes uses an existing PHP session or creates its own if none is found to
store the CAPTCHA code.  In addition, a database can be used instead of 
session storage.
    
Variables within the class are used to control the style and display of the
image.  The class uses TTF fonts and effects for strengthening the security of
the image.
    
It also creates audible codes which are played for visually impared users.
